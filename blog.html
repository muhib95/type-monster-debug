            <h2>Difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
            <p>Store data in localStorage doesn't expire, store data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends</p>

            <h2>Difference between local scope and block scope?</h2>
            <p>Locally scoped ones are only visible within the function they are declared. Each function written in JavaScript creates a new local scope and every variable declared in this scope is a local variable. That means that variables with the same name can be used in different functions.The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.</p>

            <h2>What is an event loop in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing.</p>

            <h2>how many ways to get undefined in javascript?</h2>
            <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
